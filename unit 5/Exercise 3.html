            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.<br> 
            It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development.<br>
            Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s<br>
            design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
